Line 2 will then reopen <strong>between Greenboro and Carling only</strong>. Bus route R2 will replace service on the closed portions of Line 2. Service along the full length of Line 2 is scheduled to resume <strong>Monday, Aug. 19 (6 am)</strong>.</p> <div class=\"row\"> <div class=\"col-8 col-md-4\"> <h3>Full closure</h3> <p>O-Train Line 2 will be temporarily replaced by R2 bus service from July 15 to July 21 for annual track maintenance and infrastructure upgrades. This work is required to maintain a safe and reliable service for customers. Line 2 train service between Carling and Greenboro Stations only is scheduled to resume at 6 a.m. on Monday, July 22.</p> <h3>Partial Service</h3> <p>Line 2 will run between Greenboro and Carling Stations only, from July 22 until August 18. Bayview Station will remain closed. This is required so that the Ontario Ministry of Transportation can do preparatory construction for their future Highway 417 overpass replacement. Full Line 2 service is scheduled to resume at 6 a.m. on Monday, August 19.</p> </div> <div class=\"col-8 col-md-4\"> <p><a href=\"http://www.octranspo.com/images/files/maps/line2-summer19-closure.png\"><img alt=\"Map of Line 2 full and partial closure and R2 service\" class=\"fancy_image\" src=\"http://www.octranspo.com/images/files/maps/line2-summer19-closure.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\" /></a></p> </div> </div> <h3>R2 Bus Service</h3> <p>Temporary R2 bus service will run every 15 minutes from each station. Signs at each station will show the way to the bus stops for R2 bus service. During the full closure, buses will run between Bayview and South Keys Stations. During partial service, R2 buses will run between Bayview and Carling Stations. Customers will connect between R2 buses and Line 2 trains at Carling Station.</p> <h3>Connections with R2 bus service at Bayview Station</h3> <p>Bus service at Bayview will be temporarily changed to make connections easier between Transitway bus service and the R2 replacement bus service. Starting on July 15, R2 buses will use Stop 2A, the eastbound Transitway stop on the south side of Albert Street. Also, all westbound Transitway routes will use the bus stop on Scott Street just west of Bayview Road, for a shorter walking connection to and from the R2 stop.</p> <h3>Trip Planning</h3> <p>In addition to R2 bus service, there may be other bus route options that work better for you. Use the <a href=\"http://plan.octranspo.com/plan?culture=en\">Travel Planner</a> to get your options.</p>]]></description><guid>https://www.octranspo.com/en/alerts#alert-o-train-line-2-closures-1562183770519</guid></item></channel></rss>",
